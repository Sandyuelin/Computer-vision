- [x] lecture of backpropagation
- [ ] finish svm, softmax
- [ ] read one essay with its open source (better understand the flow of the github)

### what i have done
- technical thing 
    - setup the learning environment using google colab and google drive
    - learn kNN for image classification
    - learn svm+ gradient code in thorough
    - use backpropagation to calculate the gradient 
- awareness
    - take advantage of youtube to find your learning resources 
    - feel truly respectful to people who establish, polish, and pass on the teaching materials. [cs231n website](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/) *if i become peer tutor/ ta one day, i should carry the spirit to deliver the knowledge :D*
- meeting
