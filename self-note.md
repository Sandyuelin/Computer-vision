#### In general, the work is about 
- process 2500+ data for recognition (labelme)
- learn cs231n (computer vision)
- read papers
- attend meetings
  
#### how I schedule the time
- work 9 hours per day, using 1/3 *3 method
- from 8-12, 1-5 in institute or in university
- also need to find time for java and reading


### what i have done
- technical thing 
    - setup the learning environment using google colab and google drive
    - learn kNN for image classification
    - learn svm+ gradient code in thorough
    - use backpropagation to calculate the gradient
    - learn ResNet, RNN, CNN, and MLP
    - read code and better understand the workflow of github
- awareness
    - take advantage of resourcecs
    - adopt a balanced combination of learn and do
    - feel truly respectful to people who establish, polish, and pass on the teaching materials. [cs231n website](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/) 
- meeting
