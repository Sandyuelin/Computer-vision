# convolutional neural networks for computer vision
## reminder 
- write from scratch, debug, and train CNNs through python
- state of the art software tools such as Caffe, TensorFlow, and PyTorch: very modern and using the most recent ideas and methods
- what i need to use:
  python, linear algebra, college calculus, machine learning(cost functions, taking derivatives and performing optimization with gradient descent)
